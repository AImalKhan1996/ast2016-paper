% PURPOSE: Draw the paper to conclusion and highlight some of the key empirical results

This paper introduces a cost-effective and accurate technique that performs mutation analysis for relational database schemas. \Vma~executes test suites virtually against a model of the mutated database schema. This novel approach removes the need to setup an instance of a database with the mutated schema on a real DBMS, communicate with the DBMS over a socket connection to set up the database, execute the SQL \INSERTs of a test case against it, and then tear down the database to ready it for the next test.
