% PURPOSE: Draw the paper to conclusion and highlight some of the key empirical results

This paper introduces a cost-effective and accurate technique that performs mutation analysis for relational database schemas. \Vma~executes test suites virtually against a model of the mutated database schema. This novel approach removes the need to setup an instance of a database with the mutated schema on a real DBMS, communicate with the DBMS over a socket connection to set up the database, execute the SQL \INSERTs of a test case against it, and then tear down the database to ready it for the next test. Incorporating nine representative schemas and three industry-standard DBMSs, this paper's experiments reveal that \vma~is better than the standard technique in 22 of the 27 configurations studied, yielding a time savings ranging from $13$ to $99\%$ --- and proving to the competitive with the \Original method in the other 5 cases.  Given the promise of these results, in future work we plan to ensure our models support other DBMSs and additionally extend the empirical study to include new schemas, thereby furnishing further confirmation of the extensibility and efficiency of \vma~for database schemas.
