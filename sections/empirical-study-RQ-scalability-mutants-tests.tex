\inlineheading{Saving Time with Virtual Mutation} As evident by the scatter plots in Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_scatterplot_mutantstests_percentagetimesaved}, it is useful to show how the time savings associated with using \virtualmutationanalysis~varies as the number of mutants and tests increases. Since \postgres~is a heavyweight DBMS relative to \HyperSQL~and \sqlite, the scatter plots reveal that, by avoiding database interactions, the \virtual~method yields substantial savings regardless of the number of mutants subject to analysis of the number of tests run.  Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_scatterplot_mutantstests_percentagetimesaved} also affirms that using \virtual~mutation on \HyperSQL~saves time, albeit in a way that is gradual and tapering off as there are more mutants and tests.
