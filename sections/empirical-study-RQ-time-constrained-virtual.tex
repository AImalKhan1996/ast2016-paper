\inlineheading{Virtual and Time-Constrained Mutation} Since the experiments revealed that \vma~is faster than the \Original~one in $22$ out of the $27$ studied configurations --- and competitive with the DBMS-based method in the other $5$ --- it is useful to ascertain whether the presented technique might yield more accurate mutation scores in some circumstances. To this end, Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_bwplot_schema_mutationscore_vm_tcm} presents the mutation score of both the virtual approach and a time-limited analysis in which \Original~randomly analyses mutants for as long as virtual. These box plots show that the time-constrained technique results in mutation scores that are often highly variable. This result can be attributed to randomness inherent in running mutation analysis under a strict time limit that will not permit the examination of every mutant. For instance, the noticeable variability in mutation score when the Person schema is run on \Postgres~is due to the possibility of not finishing the analysis of the first mutant.

Bearing in mind that the virtual method produces mutation scores that are always equal to those achieved by the standard technique, it is also important to note that time-constrained mutation analysis leads to overly high mutation scores.
