\inlineheading{Virtual and Time-Constrained Mutation} Since the experiments revealed that \vma~is faster than the
\Original~one in $22$ out of the $27$ studied configurations --- and competitive with the DBMS-based method in the other
$5$ --- it is important to ascertain whether the presented technique might yield accurate mutation scores in some
circumstances. To this end, Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_bwplot_schema_mutationscore_vm_tcm} presents the mutation score of
the virtual approach and a time-constrained method in which \Original~is only allowed to run for as long as virtual.
