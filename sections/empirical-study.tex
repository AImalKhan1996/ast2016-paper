\section{Empirical Results}
\label{sec:empirical-results}

% PURPOSE: Compare the virtual mutation technique to the original one in terms of their execution time, showing that
% virtual mutation is often significantly faster than the standard approach to mutation analysis.

% \subsection{Comparing Original and Virtual Mutation}
% \label{sec:empirical-study-RQ-original-virtual-time}
\input{sections/empirical-study-RQ-original-virtual-time}

% PURPOSE: Investigate the scalability of virtual mutation, looking at how the percentage of mean time saved varies as
% the number of mutants and the number of tests increases, revealing the best configurations for this method.

% \subsection{Scalability of Virtual Mutation}
% \label{sec:empirical-study-RQ-scalability-mutants-tests}
\input{sections/empirical-study-RQ-scalability-mutants-tests}

% PURPOSE: Compare the virtual and time-constrained techniques in terms of their mutation score and the number of
% mutants that are actually executed during mutation analysis, showing the superiority of virtual mutation.
