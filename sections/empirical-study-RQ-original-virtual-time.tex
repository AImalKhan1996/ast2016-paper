\inlineheading{Comparing Standard and Virtual Mutation} The box and whisker plots in Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_bwplot_schema_analysistime_org_vm} show the mutation analysis time for the two techniques across all of the relational schemas and the three DBMSs. This plot reveals that, when using the \HyperSQL~DBMS, the \virtual~method is faster than the \Original~one, especially for large schemas such as JWhoisServer. Since \Postgres~is a ``heavyweight'' disk-based DBMS, \vma~demonstrates much lower execution times than the \Original~method because it avoids database interactions. Yet, these plots show that the performance of the virtual approach is similar to the standard one when mutation analysis runs on the high-performance \sqlite~DBMS.

% PURPOSE: Analyse the trends further through the statistical analysis and the effect size computations. For effect
% sizes, make sure to comment on the fact that we did thresholding of the scores.
