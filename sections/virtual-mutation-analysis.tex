\section{Virtual Mutation Analysis}
\label{sec:virtual-mutation-analysis}

As previously described, mutation analysis of database schema involves creating the mutant schema using the DBMS, and then submitting \INSERT statements and monitoring whether the data is admitted into the database or not. If the mutant accepts or rejects \INSERT statements that the original schema did not, a difference in behavior is detected, and the mutant is ``killed''.

Program mutation analysis is an expensive process, and this is also true of database schema mutation. For database schema mutation, there are additional communication overheads with the DBMS, which typically occurs over a network socket. This can be slow even when the DBMS is running on the same machine as the process submitting the relevant SQL commands. 
% This might draw the question of why we didn't compare with mutant schemata
In previous work, we sought to minimize the amount of communication that needed to take place, for example by combining all mutants into a single database schema \cite{Wright2013}. 
Nevertheless, the overheads of setting up communication and executing SQL commands on the DBMS cannot be completely eliminated.

An alternative is to model the behavior of the DBMS and use it to perform mutation analysis ``virtually''. McMinn et al. modeled the integrity constraints of different DBMSs in order to derive different coverage criteria \cite{McMinn2015}. In this paper, we argue that such a model can be used to evaluate mutants. The existence of such a model for a DMBS makes it possible to perform mutation analysis without the need to interact with a DBMS at all, potentially speeding up the time taken to evaluate mutants.

\inlineheading{Modeling a DBMS}
McMinn et al. introduce {\it integrity constraint predicates} to model integrity constraints that can be specified as part of a database schema for a DBMS. Integrity constraint predicates evaluate to {\it true} when a row of data in an \INSERT statement satisfies the constraint, and false when it does not.

Disadvantage of \VMA is that you need a model of the DBMS.
