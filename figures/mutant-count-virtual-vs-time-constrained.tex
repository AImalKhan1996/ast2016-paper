  {\small \justifying{ \noindent In this plot the height of the bar corresponds to the number of mutants subject to
      analysis by the virtual and time-constrained methods; this count is reported for all of the chosen relational
      schemas and the three database management systems. Since the time-constrained technique employs randomness to
      select mutants that can be run within a specified time limit, the height of a light grey bar is the average across
      a total of thirty runs; virtual mutation analysis is deterministic and thus the height of the dark grey bar is a
      direct count. } \par}
