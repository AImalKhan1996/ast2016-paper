  % subcaption explains more about the configuration of the experiment that produced this graph, which is useful.

  {\small \justifying{ \noindent The meaning of this box plot's elements is the same as the meaning of those described
      in the subcaption of Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_bwplot_schema_analysistime_org_vm}. This plot shows the variation in
      the mutation score for all of the chosen relational schemas and the three database management systems, using test
      suites from thirty runs of the search-based test data generation method developed by McMinn et al.\
      \cite{McMinn2015}}. The time-constrained approach was allowed to analyze mutants for as long as the virtual mutation
      method would have run for the corresponding schema. \par}
