  {\small \justifying{ \noindent The meaning of this box plot's elements is the same as the meaning of those described
      in the subcaption of Figure~\ref{fig:graphic_bwplot_schema_analysistime_org_vm}. Additionally, in this box plot a
      filled circle denotes an outlier and the open diamond is the mean value. Using test suites from thirty separate runs
    of the search-based test data generation method developed by McMinn et al.\ \cite{McMinn2015}}, this plot shows the
    variation in the mutation score for both the virtual and the time-constrained method and for all of the chosen
  relational schemas and the three database management systems. \par}
