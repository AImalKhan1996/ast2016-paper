  given number of mutants, across all three of the database management systems (a similar graph with the number of tests
  on the horizontal axis shows the same trend as this graph). For a detailed description of how to calculate the values on the
  vertical axis, please refer to Section~\ref{sec:experimental-setup}.  } \par}
