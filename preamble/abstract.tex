	\begin{itemize}
		\item Relational schemas can include constraints that contain business logic so need to be tested.
		\item Mutation analysis can be used to model faults of omission and commission in constraints.
		\item As with mutation analysis elsewhere, it can be costly (regardless of prior researched optimisations).
		\item Virtual analysis exploits an existing model of database behaviour, used elsewhere for data generation, to reduce this \todo{to/by substantial figure here}.
		\item Therefore we can mutate even large schemas quickly, making it a practically feasible testing technique.
