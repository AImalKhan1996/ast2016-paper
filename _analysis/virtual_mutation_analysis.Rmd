This code will load in the virtual mutation package from a local directory. I was not able to get it to work with an
installation from Bitbucket because of permission errors. You will need to change the path so that it is correct for
your file system.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
options(scipen=10, width=200)
mypath = "/home/gkapfham/working/research/source/analysis/databases/"
devtools::install_local(paste(mypath, "virtualmutationanalysis", sep=""))
```
